### WHO ARE WE?

We are a company specializing in production of animated content, such as corporate or brand video, cartoon videos, commercials, and other forms of visual media. We employ concept artists, cartoon animators, writers, software developers and 3d animators to create high-quality, visually appealing animated content for a variety of different purposes, including entertainment, education, advertising, and more.


### UNDENIABLE FACT:
##### Video and animation is now used by an overwhelming majority of businesses, and consumers are ultimately relying on video content to make purchases. Before the pandemic, video made up 73% of all internet traffic. That number increased to 82% in 2022 and will increase to 91% in 2023.

###  TAKE ACTION AND STAY AHEAD OF THE TRENDS TO AVOID THOSE 5 POTENTIAL PROBLEMS THAT COULD RESULT IN LOSING YOUR CLIENTS:

**- Do You really keep up with the current digital marketing trends?**
-   The internet marketing landscape is undergoing a rapid transformation, driven by factors such as the increasing integration of AI, the rise of YouTube as the dominant platform for shaping consumer behavior, and the preference of 80% of people for video content over written text. These developments make it challenging for businesses to stay ahead of the curve when it comes to video branding, especially those that strive to offer cutting-edge solutions to their clients.


- Confidently tackle this challenge by choosing to work with the top animation studios who exhibit a true passion and dedication to staying up-to-date with the latest digital trends. That's precisely what our 3D animation studio does on a daily basis. We don't wait for someone to tell us what to research, as we actively stay informed about the current landscape on our own. Allow us to take on the responsibility of staying on top of the latest developments in product animation, brand videos, metaverse, and 3D animation.

**- Do You really stand out from the crowd?**

- Think of your prospects sitting in front of their computer. It can be tough to make your brand stand out with valuable, high-quality content. The internet is full of distractions, like exciting video games, compelling TV shows and porn (let's not pretend it's not there), that can easily take their attention away from your message. This is a common challenge for many companies trying to be influential in a crowded online environment. To succeed, marketers need to be creative and find new ways to catch their audience's eye.


- How would You like to better **captivate your audience**? 3D animation is **visually appealing** and helps grab and keep viewers’ attention. 
- How about some **more creative freedom**? 3D animation offers far more creative freedom than live-action video, allowing you to create unique and eye-catching experience.
- What we do is **easier to understand:** Animation video or 3d cartoons are a lot easier to understand than live-action video, allowing viewers to quickly grasp your concept and message.
- It's also **more engaging and versatile**: 3D animation helps create an immersive experience that allows viewers to interact with the visuals and is more versatile than live-action video, allowing you to easily customize the visuals to fit any brand or style.

**- Do not Downplay the power of emotion!**

- Emotions play a significant role in purchasing decisions because they drive people's motivations and shape their perception of products. Emotional responses can elicit a strong connection to a product, create a sense of urgency, and influence how people perceive value. When a person feels positive about a product, they are more likely to view it as valuable and make a decision about purchase which translates to Your greater income.


- Leverage the power of science and tap into the emotional drivers of purchasing decisions with our cutting-edge brand animation! We bring characters to life with dynamic gestures and expressions that rival the magic of Disney and Pixar. Immerse your audience in lush, realistic environments take them to the beauty of far sea panoramas or thriving wilderness. Put your product in the spotlight and evoke a sense of luxury and prestige through photorealistic scenes and organic motion, perfectly showcasing the unique qualities of your beauty offerings. Get ready for a breathtaking animation experience!

**- Do You accurately estimate projects or are You dangerously close to missing deadlines?**

- Meeting deadlines can be challenging for companies handling large projects that involve multiple departments, staff, and specialists. This is because it's difficult to determine deadlines, budgets, and other variables when assessments are made based on daily or monthly rates instead of focusing on the completion of the final product. This can create difficulties in managing the project effectively and meeting deadlines.


- Our company takes task estimation seriously. Before you sign a contract with us, you'll know how long each service will take to complete and how much each project will cost. We also offer a guarantee to deliver on time or you get your money back. We have a 100% record of delivering projects on time since we started in 2010 and have produced 3D content for major video shows watched by thousands of people. We understand the importance of launching on time to meet audience expectations and deliver a breathtaking experience.

**- Do You have trouble retaining quality talent?**

- It takes on average three months to onboard a new employee. Your company works hard to attract, seek out, and train new talent. Talent loss is nothing to take lightly – it is very costly. Lack of the right talent is also the leading reason why comapnies fail.  A lack of in-house artists requires many agencies and game development companies to seek third-party contractors. A rich deal for a new project is in hands, but the available designers’ team may not enough to cope with the upcoming tasks. Sound familiar?


- When you partner with us for your project, you alleviate your workload concerns. Let us do the heavy lifting of creating something spectacular, and your team will feel less stressed and more fulfilled in their work, leading to increased job satisfaction and stability.

Character animation is special and different from other types of animation like motion graphics or animated logos. It requires considerable skill to make a "living" character look believable and takes a lot of effort.
