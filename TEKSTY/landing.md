### COLLOSAL FACT:
##### Video and animation is now used by an overwhelming majority of businesses, and consumers are undeniably relying on video content to make purchases. Before the pandemic, video made up 73% of all internet traffic. That number increased to 82% in 2022 and will increase to 91% in 2023.

### LEVEL UP WITH THE CURRENT TRENDS AND AVOID THOSE **5 PROBLEMS WHICH MAY RESULT IN LOSING YOUR  CLIENTS:

**- Not keeping up with the digital advertising trends**
-   Internet marketing is rapidly changing, with  greater use of AI, YouTube surpassing Facebook as the most popular outlet for influencing consumer behavior and video being preferred by 80% of people over written text. So it’s no surprise that It can be difficult to keep up with current trends in video branding. This is especially important for businesses delivering cutting edge solutions for clients.


- To cope with this problem make sure to hire the best animation studios who show a genuine passion and interest in digital trends - which is exactly what our 3d animation studio does on a daily basis. We don’t need to be invited to do our own research as we keep up with the current landscape on our own time!  Let us do the research on the latest trends in product animation, brand videos, meta verse and 3d animation.

**- Not standing out from the crowd**

- On Your prospect's screen, It can be hard to stand out and differentiate yourself with valueable and high quality content. On your average client's internet browser - a AAA video game, trending Netflix series or just porn is just one click away - that's the direct truth. Dealing with high levels of competition or internet background noise is a challenge many companies face. To be successful, marketers need to get creative and figure out new ways to stand out in a sea of sameness. 


- How would You like to better **captivate your audience**? 3D animation is **visually appealing** and helps grab and keep viewers’ attention. 
- How about some **more creative freedom**? 3D animation offers far more creative freedom than live-action video, allowing you to create unique and eye-catching experience.
- What we do is **easier to understand:** Animation video or 3d cartoons are a lot easier to understand than live-action video, allowing viewers to quickly grasp your concept and message.
- It's also **more engaging and versatile**: 3D animation helps create an immersive experience that allows viewers to interact with the visuals and is more versatile than live-action video, allowing you to easily customize the visuals to fit any brand or style.

**- Downplaying the power of emotion!**

- In the last 2 years, we've seen a wave of sentimental and emotional content playing a huge role in the advertising industry. While you might think this is just a temporary trend which will pass away, check again.
"Appealing to customers by using solely logic and forgetting the essential role emotion plays leaves a lot of money on the table. Ultimately people buy products and services because they feel like it's the right thing to do," as quoted by Sheldon D. Goldstein. "Emotion has been scientifically proven to drive decision-making behavior. Bottom line, when properly executed, this leads to more and more conversions, sales, and revenue."

- We rely on the science which proves that emotions drive purchasing decisions. We acheive emotionality with enthusiastically animated characters - where every gesture or face expression creates a passionate performance we know from Disney’s or Pixar movies. We acheive sensitiveness by crafting lush landscapes, deep sea panoramas or wild and flourishing vistas. And then we put Your spotlight action in the middle.
